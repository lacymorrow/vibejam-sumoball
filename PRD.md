## 6. Development Guidelines

### 6.1 Code Structure
- **Client** (`src/client/`): Three.js game implementation
- **Server** (`server/`): Express server and game logic
- **Shared** (`src/shared/`): Constants and utilities shared between client/server

### 6.2 Coding Conventions
- ES6 JavaScript syntax
- Descriptive variable and function names
- Method documentation with JSDoc comments
- Modular code organization with clear separation of concerns

### 6.3 Performance Optimization
- Minimize DOM operations
- Use object pooling for frequently created objects
- Optimize physics calculations for large player counts
- Implement level-of-detail rendering for lower-end devices

### 6.4 Testing
- Test multiplayer functionality with multiple clients
- Ensure compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Verify mobile experience on iOS and Android devices
- Validate performance on lower-end hardware

## 7. Implementation Notes

### 7.1 Key Classes
- **Game**: Main game controller handling setup and initialization
- **Player**: Player data and mesh handling
- **Physics**: Simplified physics implementation
- **UI**: User interface elements and state display
- **Network**: Socket.io communication

### 7.2 Critical Algorithms
- **Collision Detection**: Sphere-to-sphere collision between players
- **Input Translation**: Converting keyboard/touch input to movement forces
- **Camera Following**: Smooth camera tracking of player position
- **Platform Shrinking**: Gradual reduction of platform size

## 8. Known Issues & Challenges

### 8.1 Current Issues
- Network latency can cause jerky movement in high-ping scenarios
- Mobile performance needs optimization on lower-end devices
- Camera controls sometimes feel restrictive

### 8.2 Technical Debt
- Physics implementation could be replaced with a dedicated physics engine
- Some UI elements need null checks to prevent errors
- Refactor needed for better separation between game state and rendering

### 8.3 Potential Challenges
- Scaling to large player counts (>20) may require architectural changes
- Supporting WebXR for VR/AR experiences
- Implementing more complex game modes while maintaining simplicity

## 9. Appendix

### 9.1 Glossary
- **Platform**: The circular arena where gameplay occurs
- **Shrinking**: The mechanism where the platform gradually becomes smaller
- **Impulse**: The force applied during collisions between players
- **Solo Mode**: Single-player practice mode
- **Camera-relative Controls**: Movement based on camera orientation rather than world coordinates
